# Udacity Memory Game
## General
This memory game was created during the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree. 

## Game functionality
The game consists of 16 cards, two of which always match. These pairs must be revealed. If two matching cards are revealed, a match is created and the cards remain on the field. If two cards do not match, the cards are turned over again. For the game, the player has an infinite number of moves. However, the higher the number of moves, the worse the star rating becomes. This ranges from one to three stars.
